Title: CeciFlags — Kids-friendly World Flags Quiz (pt-BR UI, Autism‑aware)

Goal / Description:
Build a mobile-friendly website (React + TypeScript + Vite) for a child-friendly world flags quiz. Target user: 7-year-old, autistic. The app must be colorful with gentle micro-animations, include sounds, gamification, continent filters, a timer that can be selected at the start (with Pause when timer is on), and a rewards system. It should work offline (cache flags and data) and run well in Safari. UI language: Português (Brasil). No login; all data stored locally.

Platform & Stack
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS (colorful, high contrast, large touch targets)

State: Zustand (or React Context if preferred)

Animations: Framer Motion (light micro-animations), with a global toggle to reduce motion

Audio: Howler.js (click, correct, incorrect, milestone)

Gamification: canvas-confetti (with a calm mode to disable)

i18n: simple i18n setup (default pt-BR, ready for future languages)

Offline/PWA: Service worker (Workbox) for pre-cache + runtime cache; web app works offline

Persistence: localStorage (and IndexedDB if convenient) for settings, progress, rewards

Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library (core flows)

Data & Content
Local SVG flags named by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (e.g., BR.svg, US.svg).

data/countries.json with: name_pt, iso2, continent (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania).

Provide 10–20 sample flags in repo + a README script/instructions to add all flags later.

Core Features
Game Modes

Quiz (Multiple Choice): show one large flag + 4 answer options (country names in pt-BR).

Treino (Practice): free exploration, no timer, immediate feedback, infinite time.

Continent Filter

Chips to select: África, Américas, Ásia, Europa, Oceania, ou “Mundo” (todos).

Persist last selection locally.

Timer (selected at start)

Start screen asks: Timer Off (default) or On with choices 10 / 15 / 20s.

When timer is On, show: circular visual countdown + Pause button.

When Off, no countdown; gameplay is calm and unlimited.

Feedback & Sounds

Correct/incorrect audio cues; subtle vibration (if supported) with a toggle.

Clear visual highlight of correct/incorrect answer.

Gamification

Score: +1 per correct.

Streak bonus: +1 extra for every 5 correct in a row (gentle, not flashy).

Rewards: every 10 correct answers = 1 star; every 3 stars = 1 sticker unlock.

Celebrations: small confetti/sparkles on milestones (disabled in Calm Mode).

Collection Screen: grid of stickers (locked/unlocked).

Progress & Profile (local only)

Track per-continent progress, best streak, and (if timer on) best times.

Settings (Configurações)

Language: fixed to pt-BR (i18n infra ready for future).

Toggles: Sounds, Haptics, Reduce Motion / Calm Mode, High Contrast.

Timer defaults (for next session), continent selection, and Reset Progress.

Autism‑aware & Accessibility Requirements
Calm Mode (default ON for first run): reduced motion, no confetti, softer transitions, no flashing.

Motion toggle globally controls Framer Motion intensity.

Clear, predictable layout; consistent placement of primary actions.

Large targets (min 44x44 px), generous spacing.

Readable typography: friendly rounded font; include option for increased text size.

Color‑blind safe palette and never rely on color alone for correctness; add icons/text.

Audio controls: master SFX toggle + volume slider; no sudden loud sounds.

Timer optional with Pause when enabled to avoid pressure.

Offline first: app shell and initial asset set cached for stable home/school use.

Navigation / Screens (pt-BR)
Início: “Jogar”, “Treino”, “Coleção”, “Configurações”.

Seleção de Continente: chips com estado selecionado; “Mundo” como atalho.

Tela do Quiz: flag grande, 4 opções, (se timer on) círculo de tempo + botão Pausar.

Resultado Rápido: acertos da rodada, estrelas ganhas, próximo/voltar.

Coleção: stickers desbloqueados/bloqueados com legendas.

Configurações: sons, volume, haptics, calm mode, alto contraste, idioma (fixo pt-BR), timer padrão, reset.

Offline / PWA Behavior
Pre-cache app shell, UI assets, manifest, icons, and a starter subset of flags.

Runtime cache remaining flag SVGs as visited.

Friendly offline fallback screen if needed.

Installable as a PWA (optional); must also run fine just opened in Safari.

Quality & Tooling
ESLint + Prettier; npm scripts: dev, build, preview, test.

Basic tests:

renders quiz and options

continent filter logic

timer countdown + pause

scoring + streak + reward unlock

README: how to add all flags, manage data, and deploy.

Deployment
Hosting: Replit Deploy (provide configuration files and instructions).

CI step or deploy script for building and serving static assets with service worker.

Copy & Language
App UI: Português (Brasil) (strings in /i18n/pt-BR.json).

Interaction with Replit Agent: English (this prompt).

Deliverables:
A ready-to-run React + TS project on Replit with offline support, sample flags, tests, and Replit Deploy config + README. Ensure it opens smoothly in Safari and performs well on small screens.
